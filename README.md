# Hand-motion-tracking
This Python script uses MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV to recognize hand gestures in real-time via a webcam. It maps gestures to specific characters (e.g., 'L', 'I', 'V', etc.) and opens predefined URLs (e.g., YouTube, Google) in a web browser. The gesture results are displayed on the webcam feed, and users can exit by pressing 'q'.
